# Continuous Delivery

As mentioned in the `README.md`, this tutorial builds on the [Continuous Delivery](https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/continuous_delivery) branch.

## Where to find the images

The images have been made available so that anyone can pull them and try out the tutorial on their own servers. They can be found here:

https://github.com/orgs/who-knows-inc/packages/container/package/whoknows_variations_server

https://github.com/orgs/who-knows-inc/packages/container/package/whoknows_variations_nginx

The names are defined in the [docker-compose.prod.yml](../src/docker-compose.prod.yml) file as the value of the image keys:

```yaml
    image: ghcr.io/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations_server:latest
    image: ghcr.io/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations_nginx:latest
```

## Public vs. private images

The images have been made public.

If you want to deploy your own images then you must change the visibility manually in the Github UI once. This cannot be configured in the workflow file.

It's possible to make the example work with private images by adding a login step on the server.

Since the repositories are public, there should be no problem in making the images public too.

Even with private images, should we absolutely avoid building in secrets in the images.

Instead, this example shows how to add `.env` files at runtime. See [Environment Variables](./04._Environment_Variables.md) for more.
