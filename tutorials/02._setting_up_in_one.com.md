# Prerequisite: Have a server

If you don't already have a server running or if you would like to try this setup then create a server. 

Make sure that you have a public IP.

Make sure that port 80 and 443 are open.

You can do it with the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 80
$ sudo ufw allow 443
```

$ dig A <yourdomain.com> +short
```
