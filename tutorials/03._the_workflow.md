## The tools

**Tflint** is a Terraform linter focused on possible errors, best practices, etc. It is a great tool to use to catch errors before running `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.

**Checkov** is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure as code. It scans your IaC files and looks for security issues, compliance issues, and best practices.

**Tfsec** is a static analysis tool for Terraform code. It looks for security issues and best practices.

## [Optional] Running it locally first

Always try to run the tools locally before pushing the code to the repository. 

An added benefit after [installing Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Installing%20Checkov.html) is that it will create really nice colors in the terminal unlike in the Github Action log.

## The workflow

The workflow should be suprisingly readable. It installs and runs the 3 tools mentioned above and then finalizes by running `terraform validate`.
