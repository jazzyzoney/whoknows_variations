## Defining variables

If you were to run `terraform apply` (or plan???) now, then you will be prompted to enter the values not hardcoded in `variables.tf`.

This is inconvenient, of course. The alternative is to define the values in a file named `terraform.tfvars`. This file is automatically loaded by Terraform and its values are used as default values for the variables. In a `.gitignore` template for Terraform it will be ignored.

A sample has been provided. It is named `terraform.tfvars_copy`. Copy it and name the file `terraform.tfvars`. 

**Note**: When creating the example file, make sure that no sensitive information is included.
