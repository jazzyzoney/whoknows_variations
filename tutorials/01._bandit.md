## What is `bandit`?

[Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) analyzes Python code statically and finds potential security issues. 

The official documentation can be found [here](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## The workflow file

The workflow file is named [bandit.yml](../.github/workflows/bandit.yml). It is a simple workflow that runs Bandit on the Python code in the repository.

The workflow is straight forward. In this case it runs on a single Python file but it can also be configured to run on a directory.

## The exucution

Since the server has several security vulnerabilities, the Bandit scan will fail with a list of issues.

Try fixing the issues in your own fork and try to make the scan pass.
