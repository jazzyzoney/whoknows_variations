## What is `OWASP ZAP`?

[OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a security tool that helps find security vulnerabilities in web applications. It is a widely used tool for security testing and is available as a standalone application or as a plugin for browsers. 

Unlike `bandit` and `safety`, `OWASP ZAP` requires the application to be running in order to scan it. 

There are more than one Github Marketplace Action for OWASP ZAP. The one used in this tutorial is the [OWASP ZAP Full Scan Action](https://github.com/zaproxy/action-full-scan).

## The workflow file

The workflow file is named [owasp_zap.yml](../.github/workflows/owasp_zap.yml). It is a simple workflow that runs the application locally on the runner and then runs the OWASP ZAP scan on the application.

1. 

First part of the workflow is to install and run the application. Care is taken to ensure that the application is running before the scan starts. 

```yaml
    - name: Start the application
      run: |
        python src/backend/app.py &
        sleep 10  # Give the app time to start

    - name: Ensure the app is running
      run: |
        curl --retry 5 --retry-connrefused --retry-delay 5 http://localhost:8080
```

2.  

The second part performs that scan. It's possible to make the scan create a Github Issue with the results. Here it is set to `false` to avoid creating Issues.

```yaml
    - name: ZAP Scan
      uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.10.0
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        target: 'http://localhost:8080'
        cmd_options: '-a' # automatic mode
        allow_issue_writing: false
```

3.

The last part uploads the result of the scan as an artifact. 

```yaml
    - name: Upload OWASP ZAP report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: zap-report
        path: zap.out 
```

[Here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts) is how to download the artifact.

## Giving the right workflow permissions

If you were to run the workflow right away, you will encounter the following error in the logs:

```plaintext
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

It is caused by the workflow not having the correct permissions despite having permissions set up in the Workflow file.

Permission should be granted to the workflow. 

Try doing it in the repository settings:

<img src="./assets/workflow_permissions_repository.png" alt="workflow permissions repository">

If the repository is part of an organization, the option to set it as `read/write` permission might be disabled. The solution is to set it in the organization settings first:

<img src="./assets/workflow_permissions_organisation_1.png" alt="workflow permissions organisation">
<img src="./assets/workflow_permissions_organisation_2.png" alt="workflow permissions organisation">

Then go back to the repository settings and set the permissions. 

Remember to retrigger the workflow after setting the permissions. Running the same failed workflow execution will run it with the old permission settings.
